# Comfy Creator

This is a Minecraft modpack for Minecraft Forge 1.16.5, that I made for my private server that my friends and I play on. I add to it over time. 

You're welcome to use this modpack on your own server. It's designed for survival mode. 

The primary goal of this modpack is making something fun and balanced that doesn't get boring quickly.

## You'll like this modpack if:

- You like to make big builds in survival, with lots of decorations and details.
- You like creating machines and farms that automate resource gathering, crafting, smelting, etc.
- You like exploring tech trees and learning how to do things.
- You like goofing off with friends.

## Modpack Goals

- Give players a lot of different things they can do.
- Encourage player creativity, while still in survival mode.
- Don't make things feel overwhelming or pointless.
- Make the game run smoothly on normal computers (performant).
- Don't add stuff that's OP (overpowered).
- Make building fun.
- Make resource gathering and resource farming fun.
- Add some silly little stuff here and there, just for fun.

## Feature list

- Lots of decorative blocks, doors, and furniture.
- Most resources are farmable, with some work.
- Days are now 20 minutes long (instead of 10). Nights are still 10 minutes long.
- You can make your own paintings and play musical instruments.
- Completely overhauled End Dimension, with new biomes, ores, etc.
- When you first start the game, you have the option to play as a different race with different tradeoffs ([Origins](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins)).
- Press Z to sit, and C to go prone. You can climb through 1x1 tunnels while prone.
- Press T to toggle a trash slot in your inventory.
- More compact redstone, including items for standard logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, etc).
- Craftable chunk loaders to keep your farms going even when you're away.
- Clear and connecting glass, so your windows don't have a ton of windowpanes in the middle.
- Reroll enchantments in the enchanting table by removing and re-placing the item, like in the good old days.
- Carry around sleeping bags so you can sleep wherever you are.
- Majority sleep system; only 51% of online players need to sleep for it to become daytime.
- Craftable compasses that help you find ores, structures, and biomes.
- Use the disenchanting table to take enchantments off of an item and put them in a book.
- Use the sawmill to make wood stairs and planks with fewer resources.
- There are cosmetic armor slots which you can use to override your armor appearance. When they are empty and enabled, you will appear to have no armor on (but you do).
- You can craft a banner together with a bed to put the banner on the bed like a blanket.
- When you have two doors next to each other, opening one will automatically open the other, and the same for closing.
- Energy creation machines; hand cranks, fuel burning, windmills, nuclear power, etc.
- Systems for transferring items, fluids (including potions), and energy.
- Build machines out of cogs and shafts (like [Lego Technic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Technic)), to make things move and farm resources.
- Use the Morphing Tool to keep all your tools in the same inventory slot, so you have more hotbar space.

- Sometimes there's valuable items frozen in the ice!
- Right-click on any sign to edit it.

- Atmospheric sounds and lighting. Sound effects echo in caves, you hear frogs in the swamps, there are fireflies at night, etc.
- The ability to mute, throttle, or adjust the volume of every sound effect in the game (Press Ctrl+I).
- Right-clicking path with a shovel will change it back to dirt, and you can change dirt directly to path without waiting for grass to grow on it.
- An overlay on top of the hunger meter shows how much saturation you have, how much energy you're using, and how much health, hunger, and saturation food in your hand will give you.

- There is a dummy you can hit to see the DPS of your weapon.
- There are emoji you can use in chat.
- The game is heavily optimized, with a faster rendering engine and multithreaded mod loading.
- Mipmapping and antialiasing look better than in normal Minecraft.
- Drowned have a chance to spawn with scuba gear. If you get it, it'll help you when you're underwater.
- Zombies have a chance to spawn with a mining helmet on. If you get it, you'll be able to see in the dark, because there will be a light on your head.
- When you enter a new biome, the name of the biome appears in the top-left of the screen.
- If you play music with cats nearby, they'll bob their heads, kinda like the [catJAM emoji](https://emoji.gg/emoji/5498_catJAM).
- Use shears on jack-o-lanterns to change how their face is carved. There's lots to cycle through.
- There's more stuff to make out of bamboo.
- Bonemeal works on things it doesn't normally work on, like nether wart.
- There is an item called the Plopper which will pick up items around it right before they despawn. You can use it to avoid losing stuff, or as a way to gather items into an inventory.
- Lots of new cooking recipes and foods!

## Installation Instructions (Client)

- Download the [latest zip (click Comfy.Creator-x.x.x-public.zip) on this page](https://github.com/suchipi/Comfy-Creator/releases/latest)
- Don't unzip it
- Open [the CurseForge app](https://download.curseforge.com/)
- Click on Minecraft
- Click on "Create Custom Profile"
- Click on the "import" link in "Or import a previously created profile"
- In the select file dialog it opens, choose the zip you downloaded
- Wait for it to download everything and install
- Optional step: change the amount of RAM allocated to minecraft in CurseForge's minecraft settings (the more you can give it, the better)
- Hover over the newly-created modpack, and click Play!
- It'll launch the minecraft launcher, which you can press play in.
- If it says "there is a new launcher", ignore it
- To upgrade to a new version of the modpack later, repeat these instructions.

## Installation Instructions (Server)

- Install the Client first (instructions above)
- Create a Minecraft Forge server using this version: `forge-1.16.5-36.2.39.jar`
- Open the CurseForge app and navigate to your minecraft modpacks
- Click on the image for the Comfy Creator modpack to view the modpack page
- Click the three dots button on the right to open a dropdown menu
- Click "Open Folder"
- In the folder it opens, copy the "config" and "mods" folders to your server.
- Run your Forge server normally. NOTE: You need to use Oracle Java 8, for instance, "Version 8 Update 311" or 8u311. Java 15 should also work, but NOT Java 20.
- To upgrade to a new version of the modpack later, repeat these instructions, then restart your server. If mods get removed in the new version you're upgrading to, make sure the removed mods don't remain in your server's mods folder, or else people won't be able to connect. Configs from removed mods don't hurt anything, though.

## Ideas of Things to Do with Comfy Creator

- Make a bunch of custom paintings, and build an art museum to put them all in.
- Create an evil lair where you use both magic and technology to turn cows into beef.
- Make a vehicle that runs along a gantry (from Create), so you can travel large distances more quickly.
- Put a huge drill on a minecart contraption and make it go strip mining all on its own.
- Compose a piece of music and play it with your friends using different instruments.
- Create a fancy elevator, complete with elevator music.
- Build a machine that summons lightning from the heavens, then use it to make charged creepers.
- Create a set of mana-powered armor that lets you move through the air.
- Steal a mob spawner and move it somewhere else! (Figuring out how to do this one is tough, but possible. And no, it's not Silk Touch)
- Build a battery-powered lightning staff to defeat your foes with, and find a way to charge it!
- Wear a silly mask!
- Run redstone right up the walls to hide contraptions more easily (use the redstone pen or redstone quill)
- Use Applied Energistics 2 to solve your item organization problems!
- Build a traditional Japanese village!
- Make a scale replica of a famous building, then cause a nuclear meltdown inside to destroy it!
- Celebrate friend's successes with confetti and fireworks!
- Disguise blocks as sand to make mind-boggling structures!
- Enchant a scythe and behead your friends, then put their heads on sticks outside your house!
- Build a bridge with all the blocks glued together, then use a mechanical bearing to rotate it up at a 45 degree angle. Now you have a ramp!
- Make a building that folds up and down like a pop-up book!
- Build a court of law, then use the gavel and lawyer badges to roleplay a case!
- Wear a warlock's hat and show it off to your friends!
- Build a complex ventilation shaft system, then roleplay a heist with your friends!
- Use dark rituals to speed up the sun and surprise your friends!
- Make a home among the danger and beauty of the new End biomes.

## Known Problems

- The sound culling/blocking/volume changes don't load properly when the game starts. As a workaround, press Ctrl+I to open the sound interface, and press "Done". Your previous changes will now be applied.
- There is a bug where sometimes you don't automatically get out of bed once it's morning. You'll have to get out of bed manually.
- Due to the optimized renderer, the blocks that Portality portals are made out of are invisible when in a player inventory or chest. They're still there, though, and will become visible once placed down.
- If you put a Portality portal in a chunk loaded by a chunk loader, undesirable and potentially server-crashing behavior can occur. To avoid this, never use Portality portals in chunk-loaded chunks.
  - Specifically: When you dial another portal, Portality forceloads the chunk where the other portal is. When the connection is closed, both ends get un-forceloaded. This can be bad if there is a chunk loader in the same chunk as one of the portals, because the chunkloader forceloads it, and the portal un-forceloads it, so it ends up not forceloaded even though there's a chunk loader in the chunk.
  - Additionally, if there's an item-creating farm in the chunk, and the portal disables its forceloading, and a chunk *adjacent* to the now-un-forceloaded chunk is forceloaded, then the chunk with the item farm will now [be "Ticking" but not "Entity Ticking"](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Chunk#Tickets), which means the item entities that are being created by the farm will never fall onto the appropriate hopper/lava/etc. This can end up crashing the server, because there's so many item entities in that chunk.
